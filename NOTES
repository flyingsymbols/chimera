The psycopg2 source is stored in /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/psycopg2
on my ubuntu box

git diff a few versions back works like

git diff HEAD^ # diff with one version back
git diff HEAD^^ # diff with two versions back

in psycopg2/pool.py there are several connection pool methods
in psycopg2/extras.py there are logging connections and cursors
    also dictionary cursors and connections

for making a code object become a true function:
import types
help(types.FunctionType)
